# LoL Data

I made some scripts to pull from a public API and store the data into a database. I then made a front end to display that data and do some other things. Tried to learn some new things along the way.

Now comes with a Docker file, but you'll have to modify config.toml and resources/python/general.cfg to point to a database.
